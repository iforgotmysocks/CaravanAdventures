Welcome to the beta for Caravan Adventures. As always, please backup your savegames. I'm glad for any feedback and bugs you may find or can provide. :)

1.3 compatibility update is out!

[b]The release will be published as a new workshop file while this beta will remain unlisted and will eventually be removed, so please don't waste your hard earned steam points on the beta version.[/b]

Caravan Adventures aims to transform traveling around the world into a fun adventure by providing new features to replace the annoying micromanagement, make traveling more fun and give you a sense of purpose doing so. Quick heads-up, 

about 25% of this mod's content is the Storyline, which requires Royalty. Everything else can be used without it, don't worry. 

Feedback would be amazing, please join me [url=https://discord.gg/KwaRubs2kx]discord[/url] and let me know what you think. Thanks guys!

[h1]Automatic Camp Setup[/h1]
[list]
[*] Settle on tiles by having your pawns set up a camp first, before you even get involved. 
[*] If you prepared and have enough spacer tent supplies, you will be able to stay in high quality camp sites, if not, ur pawns will divert to make shift materials.
[*] Your pawns automatically build enough tents for your individual number of travelers and prisoners. Pawns also choose their tents based on their relationship.
[*] Choose to either leave the bulk of most items strapped to your animals or create enough storage tents, so all your equipment is tugged away "safely".
[*] Choose to pre-apply basic jobs, like creating a set of fresh clothes, butcher animals or grill some stakes
[*] Leave the camp site immediately if you want to, just for the impatient ones
[/list]

[list]
[*] Set up 3 presets in mod settings, that allow you to quickly select all items for travel, or create specific trade filters to select all you may want to sell at once.
