Welcome to the beta for Caravan Adventures. As always, please backup your savegames. I'm glad for any feedback and bugs you may find or can provide. :)

Caravan Adventures aims to transform traveling around the world into a fun adventure by stripping away all the little annoying things that require alot of micro management or just aren't fun. It also provides the player with a few reasons to travel. Quick heads-up, about 25% of this mod's content is the Storyline, which requires Royalty. Everything else can be used without it, don't worry. 

Let me give you an overview over what this mod provides:
(All categories can be enabled or disabled and further configured to your liking in the mod's settings) 


[h1]Automatic Camp Setup[/h1]
[list]
[*] Settle on tiles by having ur pawns set up a camp first, before you even get involved. 
[*] If you prepared and have enough spacer tent supplies, you will be able to stay in high quality camp sites, if not, ur pawns will divert to make shift materials.
[*] You pawns automatically build enough tents for your individual number of travelers and prisoners. Pawns also choose their tents based on their relationship.
[*] Choose to either leave the bulk of most items strapped to your animals or create enough storage tents, so all your equipment is tugged away "savely".
[*] Choose to preapply basic jobs, like creating a set of fresh clothes, butcher animals or grill some stakes
[*] Leave the camp site immediately if you want to, just for the impatient ones
[/list]
[h1]Caravan forming / trading presets[/h1]
[list]
[*] Set up 3 presets in mod settings, that allow you to quickly select all items for travel, or create specific trade filters to select all you may want to sell at once.
[*] More basic selection options for all items or none
[*] Keep the automatic supplies disabled with a toggle, to avoid some lag when it's active everytime you open up the dialog
