The mod offers some additional features you can enable to make the day to day on the road more enjoyable. A few story related settings can be found in the story options, like removing the royal title requirements up to a certain title.

## Available features:

### Auto-cleanup for abandoned settlements
Removes blockers for abandoned settlements over time.

### Increase settlement food and silver
Increase npc settlement's available silver and food by 2-3 and 1.5-2, respectively. More food for the road.

### Increased Ancient shrine reward chance
Adds the chance for a second valuable item when raiding ancient shrines (heavily nerfed for story master shrines)

### Later skill point decay 
Increases the level to 15, when the skill decay starts to set in, so your travelers have it easier being on the road for longer durations

### Enable side bar button to close letters
Adds a small button to the toggle settings on the right side bar allowing you to close all open letters with a single click
