### Can x about the camping feature be changed
The Mod settings give you a bunch of settings you can play with, however most camp related functionalities are imbedded into the code and exposing them to xml would require alot more work and complex coding to make it applicable. Feedback and improvement suggestions are always welcome, some tents are yet to receive a few more custom buildings, but please keep in mind that xml exposure for the entire camping feature will not happen anytime soon, if at all.

However the camp builder was created with polymorphism support in mind, so you can inherit from the CA Camp Builder, and override parts to implement your own logic.

### Can i use this without royalty?
Yes! U'll only miss out on the storyline, but the other 6 major categories are still available.  
### How can i enter the village???  
Check the <a href="https://github.com/iforgotmysocks/CaravanAdventuresWiki/wiki/Storyline">storyline section</a>  
### Why r so many centipedes attacking the npc village, i only have 3 pawns with sticks???

### Where do the whispers come from???
Check the <a href="https://github.com/iforgotmysocks/CaravanAdventuresWiki/wiki/Storyline">storyline section</a>  
### Can it be added to an ongoing playthrough?
Yes, but keep in mind that removing/disabling the storyline on an ongoing save is currently experimental. Other mod categories can freely be enabled and disabled and only require a restart to take effect. To remove the mod, backup your saves, enable the mod's debug settings and select "Remove mod (Exp.)". Now save the game and remove the mod. However simply pushing the button and not removing the mod physically is still the best option.  

# Recommendations

### Runtime GC
* having lots of world pawns saved slows the game down alot, which is especially noticeable when traveling the world map in a caravan. Clearing those up can get you alot more speed and tps.

### Rocketman
* Slowing down the tickrate for worldpawns is the next best thing!
