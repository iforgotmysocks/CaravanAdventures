# Story line

*You have been fighting off various dangers on this Rimworld, be it fauna or flora, be it raiders or rogue mechaniods, yet the biggest danger still lies out there dormant. And waiting.*

*And there suddenly, between day to day mental breaks and the usual insanity, a larger than usual caravan approaches. The fact that they seemed armed to their teeth and equipped with frightingly effective gear, renders the picture of the young woman waving at you with a slight smile on her face rather bizarre...* 

## Royalty dependancy

Sorry about that, but since i've been using a bunch of royalty features that i actually like, i didn't feel like replacing them with possibly worse mechanics to make up for their functionality. All other mod features can be used without it, only the story requires it. The story is only a part of this mod and the main bulk of content provided will turn your travels into hell of a lot more fun - even without a story line.

## Story content  
 <img src="Images\CrystalScythe.png" height="200" alt="pic"/>   
 
Depeding on your means of travel and the state of your faction's power due to mods or time played, the story can either be a relatively short and fun adventure with possibly endless grinding opportunities, or a really time intensive, challanging and grant journey. Many aspects can be adjusted to your playstiye if distances seem too short / far or enemies too strong or too weak. The mod settings are well structured and should be easy to navigate.

## Quest tips

Some parts of the story aren't all that easy, depending on your play style. You can expand the sections that are relevant to you to gain some additional info on how to handle certain issues

**Consider all colapsed sections Spoilers!**
<details>
    <summary>The trade caravan</summary>

* If you missed the first one, don't worry. Further caravans will arrive that you can talk to. However you also may be visited by a non quest caravan of their faction.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>The village</summary>

* Getting the towns folk out is enough, no need to die protecting the village if you can't win.
* However protecting it may leave you with a closeby allied settlement you can trade with.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>The whispers</summary>

* In case you really couldn't follow the sound to find it - it's the anima tree. Go talk to it!

<details>
    <summary>Hints of dangerous shrines</summary>

* The journey will be long, unless you choose to play with mods mitigating half the fun of all the new caravaning features this mod provides, make use of them. Camp regulary, keep your colonists happy and your food supply stocked (and prepare for some frosty winds)

* Hints may turn out as ambushes or the real thing. Ancient master shrines. Don't take them on unprepared, they can be quite dangerous.
* Ancient master shrines aren't necessarily meant to be rushed. The map will remain if you leave or espace, so you can always return stronger. (And possibly collect some mech bounty credit to call in reinforcements)
* Mech patrols will check up on those shrines regulary, so make sure you're not around when they arrive. They will leave again after a few hours if they can't find any hostiles.
* However you can still abandon the map if you want to and give up on your clue. Which gives you a chance to fight a different boss the next time around.
* If you struggle too much or shrines are too easy, don't forget about the mod settings allowing you to adjust the multipliers for the help you initially get and how strong the enemy should be.

    <summary>The Apocaplyse</summary>

* No worries, u've got time. It progresses rather slowly. But it will keep on progressing indefinitely unless stopped.
* For the sake of realism, the mod comes with a modsetting allowing you to apply the apoc's temperature change to the general world map and traveling caravans. That's not a thing in vanilla and hurts the scenary quite a bit, but makes later travels alot harder when it gets cold. Frequent frostbite isn't fun and may require more stops.
* You can adjust the progression rate in settings. Make use of it to find the correct and fun pace for urself, or stop progression entirely if u're not into the idea.
* If you like the apocalypse, there is no need to hold off finishing the story to keep it going. You may find urself suprised what the ending offers.

<details>
    <summary>The final fight</summary>

* Have your gifted pawn be prepared. They will have to sustain quite a bit of damage, the ancient protective aura is likely a must, have it active.

### Ancient Thunderbolt <img src="Images\Thunderbolt.png" height="50" alt="pic"/>  
Strikes a smaller area with an array of deadly thunder bolts, can kill enemies of weaker statue instantly and is truely a means of mass destruction.

### Ancient Meditation <img src="Images\Meditate.png" height="50" alt="pic"/>  
Requires long and deep meditation to restore a base amount of psyfocus, which gets a massive bonus by all flora in the proximity which can be drained for energy.

### Ancient protective aura <img src="Images\Protect.png" height="50" alt="pic"/> 
Allows the caster to channel psyfocus to directly strenghten the bodies capabilities in almost any humanly possible way. Agility, melee combat, aswell as endurance are highly increased. It also protects the target from a large part of incoming damage, fire, heals wounds over time (even permanent ones when active long enough).

Reduces the overall psy-heat a pawn can handle and accelerates psyfocus drain by 2% / day while active. The effect of this spell disappears if cast a second time or no more psyfocus is available. 

Requires the ancient gift, unless enhanced by The Ancient Coordinator spell.

### Ancient Coordinator <img src="Images\Circles.png" height="50" alt="pic"/> 
The caster aswell as 4 other colonists are granted the power of the ancient protective aura without any downsides as long as the caster is alive. However, every other pawn exceeding the limit of 5 will die.
