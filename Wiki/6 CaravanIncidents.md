# Caravan Incidents

Alot can happen on the road that's why this mod adds additional incident(s), that are more sturctured to not always have to end in a fight, but may even be resolvable due to actions you might take within the dialog. 

Currently only 1 additional Event is included, but there may be more coming.

## Damsel in distress
Your scouts noticed a pretty girl being taken hostage by some rough low lifers. What would you like to do? 
* Charge in and attack them head on?   
-> leads to fight on the map
* Wait until dark, sneak into their camp and take them out silently  
-> chance based outcome relying on your melee and hunting skills  
-> can be successful without a fight on a loaded map
* Leave the girl to her fate?
