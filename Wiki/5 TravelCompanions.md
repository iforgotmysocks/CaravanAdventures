# Travel Companions

Fighting along side each other on countless adventures, mastering the cruelest of twists together, yet even after years together pawns may end up liking a new pawn instantly more then they may do most of their group. That didn't seem right. 

This feature introduces a new relationship kind between your pawns that strenghtens over time the longer they are together. This new relationship morrors itself in the personal mood of the individual pawn aswell as their personal relation towards each other pawn in your group. 

While this offers the chance for pawns, that have known each other for many years and faced countless challenges together, to really feel like an inportant part of their group, it also leads to distrust and some discontent against newcomers. Where did they come from? Why did they join and can they be trusted? Or will they cause the collapse of your group? The same way a new pawn will feel uncertain about their fate in their new group and home. How will they be treated? Will they ever be the odd one out? Are they even save?
