# Camping / Automatic Camp Setup

Camping is an important part when it comes to long distance journeys and to make it more enjoyable, this mod gives your pawns the ability to settle without dropping all their items all over the place, to set up a camp for themselves which includes various types of tents, pre-applied jobs, zones and other features and the ability to night travel if need be.

## Settle as Caravan
The first gizmo/icon allows your caravan to settle with all your items still packed and adds an alert which starts the unloading process when clicked. This allows you to find a decent place first and maybe build some storage buildings instead of scattering all your precious gear on the ground. However this option will not lead to an assembled camp.

## Settle with Camp
You can select the "Settle with Camp" button having a caravan selected, so your pawns know they should construct a camp when settling.
The settle icon shows how many spacer camp supplies your caravan has available and an approximate value how many would be required for a high quality camp.
If you do not have enough, your pawns will use makeshift materials they may find in nature, however a high tech camp will come with alot of advantages which are listed down below.

Upon settling, your pawns will choose their tents and bed roll setups depending on their relations towards each other.
Prisoners will be placed in for prisoners dedicated tents and your animals get a small place for themselves. 
Your equipment, depending on settings, will either be placed in enough storage tents as are required, or remain stored on your animals and pawns.

Spacer camp supplies can be produced at the machining table or fabrication bench for 3 components, 25 plasteel and 10 chemfuel.

Depending on if you have a makeshift camp or a high tech camp, most tents come with different furniture, 
different job pre-applied, and different efficiencies. As an example, a makeshift camp comes with a tent for food, however a high tech camp would comes with a cooler preinstalled to keep food frozen.
Important to note, most camp related buildings can not be build manually. Camps should be a temporary solution, so if more space or other buildings are required, start expanding with the gear you have access to. 

### Camp control & Camp fire with grill

<br>  

You can right click the camp fire to bring up the additional camp control options which allow you to:

* pack up your camp by taking down tents to either leave or make room for other buildings
* pack up your camp and leave the map immediately, which will bring up the caravan forming dialog and skip the lengthy caravan packing process

The campfire grill is part of the high tech camp and allows you to cook grill snacks. They offer slightly less nutrition compared to normal meals, but won't cause food poisoning.
A basic job for grill snacks or normal meals for 3x the pawn count comes pre-applied.
When a high tech camp is packed up, about 66% of the used camp supplies can be recovered and used again for the next camp. This applies to both options listed above.

*Spacer Camping supplies needed for high tech camp: 1*
### Sleeping tent

The number of tents varies based on how many travelers your caravan exists of. A tent houses 3 people and pawns will choose and place single or double bedrolls, depending on their relationship status.
High tech sleeping tents, as well as most tents pawns generally spent more time in come with a dedicated combined camping heater and AC unit, which can battle both heat and the cold in a limited capacity.
The makeshift version comes with a torch and passive cooler instead, which are less efficient.
*Camping supplies: 3*

### Prisoner Tent
Same as the sleeping tent, but dedicated for prisoners, which get placed there automatically by your pawns.  

*Camping supplies: 3*

### Production tent
This tent offers some basic equipment needed for general tasks a camp always needs. It also has pre-applied jobs for the most common things, like butchering animals on the butcher table or crafting a basic set of clothes.
A high tech camp will come with an additional small comms console and a small bio fuel refinery, which allows to produce bio fuel that most high tech camp buildings require to function.  

*Camping supplies: 4*

### Medical tent
The medical tent is filled with medical bed rolls more suited to keep injuries and sickness in check. The tent also comes with a small shelf / zone for meds pre-applied and is temperatured by means of the camp kind.

*Camping supplies: 4*

### Storage tent
This tent is used to store your precious gear and protect it from the elements. 
A high tech camp will come with a trade beacon preinstalled.
Depending on your settings you can leave your gear packed on your animals and pawns instead of using storage tents.

*Camping supplies: 3*

### Food tent
The food tent is a specialized kind of the storage tent and contains food.  
Food is exempted from the option to leave your equipment packed, same as some medicine for 
the medical tent, so your pawns have access to food and medicine.

*Camping supplies: 3*

### Animal area
Your animals obviously also get a spot including a pre-applied zone for food and 2 pre-applied areas, one which 
exempts the food and plant tents, and another which confines them to their camping area. The default animal 
area can be set in the camp settings.

*Camping supplies: 1*

### Growing tent
The growing tent is high tech specific and allows to grow a few plants in a greenhouse sort of tent. However the generator supporting the sunlamp is quite bio fuel hungry. Suitable to be expanded with additional plant trays. 

*Camping supplies: 6*

## Night travel
Traveling in the night may sometimes be required if your pawns are able, but can't be done if pawns are fully exhausted. An extra icon was added for it.

## Mod Settings
Following settings can be configured within the mods settings:
* camp map size
* configure which tent types should be build by your pawns
* auto apply camp gear recipes (food for the camp fire, clothes, ...)
* auto apply zone for snow to be cleared within the camp
* generate storage for all inventory items - when unchecked, most items will remain packed on animals and pawns
* let animals mostly run free instead of limiting them to their small animal area (choosing their applied area)
* fence posts only decorative, when unchecked fence posts will protect animals from wild animals and raiders, however they can still be shot
* show camp supply cost approximate on settle gizmo / icon
* define the maximum camp supply cost used
* disable camp supply costs which will always lead to a high tech camp being build
* starting fuel percentage for camp-gear
