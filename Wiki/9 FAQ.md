# Frequently asked Questions

### Can x about the camping feature be changed
The Mod settings give you a bunch of settings you can play with, however most camp related functionalities are imbedded into the code and exposing them to xml would require alot more work and complex coding to make it applicable. 

However the camp builder was created with polymorphism support in mind, so you can inherit from the CA Camp Builder, and override parts to implement your own logic for your mod.

# Recommendations

### Use Runtime GC for 1.2
* having lots of world pawns saved slows the game down alot, which is especially noticeable when traveling the world map in a caravan. Clearing those up can get you alot more speed and tps.
