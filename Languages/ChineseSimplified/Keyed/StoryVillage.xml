	<!-- EN: Dear {0},\n\nI really hope u get this letter in time, or we might all be dead. We came across a large shrine and as we cracked it open masses of mechanoids streamed out. We got away, but ever since huge hordes of mechanoids keep attacking our village.\nI'm sending this letter in hope that you can make it here in time to assist us. We're preparing an escape, but we have to wait for our reinforcements to stand any chance of escaping with our lives.\n\nPlease help us in those dark times and venture to {1} at haste, we'd never forget this great deed. -->
  <StoryVillageQuestLetterContent>亲爱的{0}，\n\n我真希望你能及时收到这封信。如果再晚一点，我们可能就已经命丧黄泉了。在先前的探索中，我们偶然发现了一座巨大的圣殿。当圣殿的大门被开启后，机械族如洪水般从里面涌了出来。虽然我们设法逃走了，但从那以后，每天都有大批机械族向我们的城镇发起进攻。\n我寄出这封信是希望你们能及时赶来帮帮我们。我们已经制定了一个逃脱计划，但如果没有协会总部援军的支持，我们很难成功实施。\n\n相信你们一定能在这至暗时刻拯救我等于水火之中，我们将永远不会忘记这一伟大的功绩。\n(信件的末尾标注了求援地点：{1})</StoryVillageQuestLetterContent>
	<!-- EN: PS: I hope you guys are doing well, I really miss talking to you, I had such a great time when we met. I hope to see you soon, aiding us again. -->

  <StoryVillage_Dia1_1>哦，是{0}！感谢老天，你们终于来了。我们几乎快撑不住了。我们的侦察兵报告说，下一波机械族的数量极其庞大，而且将在几分钟内抵达。\n\n唉，真希望我们的援军能够及时赶到。</StoryVillage_Dia1_1>
	<!-- EN: Good to see you. Any idea why those mechs are after you that bad?\nWe sure get attacked as well, but nothing as you described. -->
  <StoryVillage_Dia1_1_Option1>很高兴看到你没事。那些机械族为什么对你们紧追不放？\n虽然我们也遭到了机械族的袭击，但远没有你说的那么夸张。</StoryVillage_Dia1_1_Option1>
	<!-- EN: [{0}, pale and exhausted, looks you in the eyes] We don't know exactly. It was a huge shrine. Once we discovered the hordes of mechs coming out of that place we used our last nuke to level the whole place. But it looks like most made it out and they're after us now.\n\n[{0} hands you a small device in haste] Take this comms device, so I'll be able to contact you. -->
  <StoryVillage_Dia1_2>[{0}面色苍白，看起来有些精疲力竭]我们也不清楚...不过那可真是座巨大的圣殿。当发现机械族如洪水般从里面涌出后，我们便启动了最后一枚核弹头将整片地区夷为平地。不过即便如此，还是有大量机械族幸免于难并对我们穷追猛打。\n\n[{0}连忙递给你一个对讲机]拿好这个对讲机，我会继续与你们保持联系的。</StoryVillage_Dia1_2>
