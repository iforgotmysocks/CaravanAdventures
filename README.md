# CaravanAdventures

Welcome to the beta for Caravan Adventures. As always, please backup your savegames. I'm glad for any feedback and bugs you may find or can provide. :)

Caravan Adventures aims to transform traveling around the world into a real adventure by providing new features to replace the annoying micromanagement, make traveling more fun and give you a sense of purpose doing so. Quick heads-up, about 25% of this mod's content is the Storyline, which requires Royalty. Everything else can be used without it, don't worry. 

Feedback would be amazing, please join our <a href="https://discord.gg/KwaRubs2kx">discord</a> and let us know what you think. Thanks guys!

## Automatic Camp Setup
* Settle on tiles by having ur pawns set up a camp first, before you even get involved. 
* If you prepared and have enough spacer tent supplies, you will be able to stay in high quality camp sites, if not, ur pawns will divert to make shift materials.
* Your pawns automatically build enough tents for your individual number of travelers and prisoners. Pawns also choose their tents based on their relationship.
* Choose to either leave the bulk of most items strapped to your animals or create enough storage tents, so all your equipment is tugged away "safely".
* Choose to preapply basic jobs, like creating a set of fresh clothes, butcher animals or grill some stakes
* Leave the camp site immediately if you want to, just for the impatient ones

## Caravan forming / trading presets
* Set up 3 presets in mod settings, that allow you to quickly select all items for travel, or create specific trade filters to select all you may want to sell at once.
* More basic selection options for all items or none
* Keep the automatic supplies disabled with a toggle, to avoid some lag when it's active everytime you open up the dialog

## Mechanoid Bounty
* Initialy part of the story, but also seperately available
* Hunt mechanoids to receive bounty credits with the faction that called out the bounty
* Get assistance from said faction on any map you currently have pawns located (they can help engage hostile locations)
* Hire veteran soldiers for a hefty large amount of bounty credits, which come with alot of experience and u're able to choose some of their traits
* Purchase valuable items in exchange for bounty credits
* Improve relations to other factions in exchange for bounty credits
* Buy bounty credits for a large amount of silver

## Immersion - Travel companions
* Pawns start out disliking the newcomers due to uncertainty and some lack of trust
* Pawns indiviually bond with eath other over time which can turn the initial distrust into a true friendship

## Caravan Incidents
* More smaller events that do not always have to end in a fight (currently only 1)

## Storyline (requires Royalty)
* A storyline that gives you a reason to travel the world
* Form a bond with a new faction sharing your troubles on a new world
* Encounter a dangerous threat that endangers the entire world
* Fight bosses to claim treasures, learn powerful spells and prevent the end of all living beings
